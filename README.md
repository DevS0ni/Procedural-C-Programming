Course Information
----------------------------------------
After successful completion of this course, it helped me to...

```
  * Gain a basic understaning of C programming.
  * Gain a handsome knowledge on all of the procedural aspects of C programming namely-
     - Intro to C Programming.
     - Difference between Procedural aspects & Object-Oriented Programming.
     - Naming Conventions.
     - Variables (Tokens, Identifiers), Data Types.
     - Operators (Arithmetic, Relational, Bitwise, Assignment, Logical, Misc)
     - Ternary Operators & Operators Precedence.
     - Conditional Constructs/ Conditional Statements (Simple if, if...else, if...else if...else,
       nested if...else, switch case - selective construct)
     - Iterative Constructs/ Loops (for, while, do...while loops)
     - Control Statments (break, continue, goto-jumping statement)
     - Functions (Standard Library functions & User Defined Functions)
     - String functions & Manipulations.
     - Recursion/ Pattern programs (Calling functions recursively - fibonacci, factorial, patterns-*,#)
     - Arrays & Operations on Arrays (1D Arrays & 2D Arrays) [Homogenous Datatype]
     - Structures & Unions [Heterogenous Datatype]
        * Nested Structure
        * Embedded Structure
     - Pointers
        * Pointer arithmetic
        * Pointer to pointer
        * Array with Pointers
        * Pointers with functions (Passing pointers to functions & Returning Pointers from a function)
        * Pointers with Structures
     - File Handling (file operations-read,write,append)
     - Dynamic Memory Allocation (malloc & calloc)
     - Debugging Methods & Troubleshooting, Walkthroughs, Modular Aspects of Programming.
     - Syntactic and Semantic Errors
 ```

I declare that the code in this repository is entirely my own work.

NOTE: For others, this repo can be a good reference, if someone wants to learn &
understand the aspects of C programming and it's topic but must not copy the
work completed by me!
